# Wine-Analysis-With-R

## Project Overview
In this project, you will use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques in a selected dataset to discover relationships among multiple variables, and create explanatory visualizations illuminating distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

## Introduction

For the final project, you will conduct your own exploratory data analysis and create an RMD file that explores the variables, structure, patterns, oddities, and underlying relationships of a data set of your choice.

The analysis should be almost like a stream-of-consciousness as you ask questions, create visualizations, and explore your data.

This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer. As John Tukey stated, "The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data." We want you to ask interesting questions about data and give you a chance to explore. We will provide some options of data sets to explore; however, you may choose to explore an entirely different data set. You should be aware that finding your own data set and cleaning that data set into a form that can be read into R can take considerable time and effort. This can add as much as a day, a week, or even months to your project so only adventure to find and clean a data set if you are truly prepared with programming and data wrangling skills.
